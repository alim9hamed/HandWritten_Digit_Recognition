# Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Overview

Handwritten digit recognition is a pivotal application of AI, with significant implications in industries like banking and data entry. This project utilizes the MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9).

## Project Description

To tackle the handwritten digit recognition problem, I developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras. The process included the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset, followed by splitting it into training and validation sets.
  
2. **Model Architecture**: Building the CNN with convolutional and max-pooling layers to extract features, culminating in a fully connected layer for digit classification.

3. **Training**: The model was trained using the Adam optimizer, focusing on minimizing sparse categorical cross-entropy loss.

4. **Evaluation**: After training, the model's performance was evaluated on test data, and predictions were visualized on sample images, achieving promising results.
